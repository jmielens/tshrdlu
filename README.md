Authors: **Jim Evans and Jason Mielens** ( {j.s.evans,jmielens}@utexas.edu )

This is a fork of the original tshrdlu repository used for a class project 

The name "tshrdlu" comes from Twitter+[SHRDLU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU).

For more information, updates, etc., follow [@appliednlp](https://twitter.com/appliednlp) on Twitter. The [@tshrdlu](https://twitter.com/tshrdlu) account may also start doing some tweeting of its own soon (by which I mean automated tweeting).

## Requirements

* Version 1.6 of the Java 2 SDK (http://java.sun.com)
